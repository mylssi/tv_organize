tv_organize
==================

Parses directory and filenames of TV series scene releases and creates directory structure and symlinks to the original files. The resulting directory structure is understood by XBMC. 

Run like this:

organize /mnt/downloads/TV-X264/An.Idiot.Abroad.S02E06.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA/

Result is symlink:

/mnt/downloads/Organized/TV/An.Idiot.Abroad/Season_2/An.Idiot.Abroad.S02E06.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA
-> /mnt/downloads/TV-X264/An.Idiot.Abroad.S02E06.720p.HDTV.x264-TLA
